# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification
>	Here you will briefly explain the domain of the problem you identified, briefly identify general challenges and, then, state you problem

# Context

The context of this work is the management and maintenance of vehicles.
Keeping a vehicle in a good state its not an easy job. We have to remember a lot of tasks such as scheduling servicing (agendar revis√µes), paying insurance and taxes (such as IUC) and monitoring expenses.
This context is interesting because, despite the importance of these tasks, many people find it difficult to organize them and sometimes we forget that we have to pay a tax or that we have to change oil, etc.

# Challenges

Organized information: Keep the history of maintenance, insurance, taxes and expenses centralized and acessible
Personalization: Adapt the reminders and some key elements to different types of persons and their wants with the application.
Integrate extern services: Keep connection beetween mechanics and normal users
Acessabilty: As we said on Personalization we want to make a app that everyone can use

# The goal

Create an application that simplifies and centralizes vehicle management, sending personalized reminders and offering tools to keep the car in a good state.
