# Self-Evaluation and Workload

### Strengths
##### User-Centered Approach: 
Every decision was backed by research and testing

##### Problem-Solving: 
Addressed pain points (like reminders) with creative solutions

##### Teamwork: 
We worked well together, leveraging each other's strengths and making, in our opinion, a great product

### Weaknesses
##### Time Management:
We could have started the project earlier, which would have allowed us to make the initial part of the logbook more complete
##### Areas to Improve:
Some edge cases were not covered like the notifications beeing sent, the workshops interface (we could have added a user only for a workshop)
