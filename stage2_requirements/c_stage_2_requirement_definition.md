# Scenarios


## Scenario 1: Maria Manages Her Car Maintenance

Maria, a 72-year-old retiree, has constantly valued her independence and loves riding her vehicle to visit friends. However, she frequently struggles with remembering renovation schedules and essential closing dates, which include paying her automobile insurance or street tax (IUC). Today, she determined to apply the vehicle control app that her son, Rafael, endorsed.

As she opened the app, Maria saw a simple and clear interface. The app, privy to her vehicle's details, confirmed her a dashboard with upcoming responsibilities: a reminder to pay the IUC in weeks and a notification that her subsequent oil exchange is due in 500 kilometers. The app also highlighted a nearby garage, JosÃ© Carlos's workshop, with desirable opinions and less costly fees.

Maria felt relieved understanding she didnâ€™t have to take into account these tasks herself. Later, she acquired a notification from Rafael, who also has to get admission to her vehicleâ€™s profile, reminding her to agenda the oil change.

With the app, Maria felt safer with her automobileâ€™s protection, and Rafael become satisfied that he could help his mother remotely.
